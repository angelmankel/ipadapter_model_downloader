Downloading the ipadapter models is a pain. Made this to automate that process.

1. `git clone` or download this repo into your ComfyUI root directory. So for example: C:/Documents/ComfyUI/ipadapter_model_downloader
2. Open the ipadapter_model_downloader folder
3. Run the ipadapter_model_downloader.py file using Python and it should show progress in the terminal.
